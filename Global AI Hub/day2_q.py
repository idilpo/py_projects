# At a particular company, employeesâ€™ salaries are raised progressively, calculated using the following formula:
# salary = salary + salary x (raise percentage)
# Raises are predefined as given below, according to the current salary of the worker.
# if 0<salary<=1000 then 15%
# if 1000<salary<=2000 then 10%
# if 2000<salary<=3000 then 5%
# if 3000<salary then 2.5%
# Write a program that asks the user to enter their salary.
# Then your program should calculate and print the raised salary of the user.
# Some example program runs:
# Please enter your salary: 1000 Your raised salary is 1150.0.
# Please enter your salary: 2500 Your raised salary is 2625.0.
