# Create 5 students. Ask these students from the user.
# Each of these students should have a midterm grade, project grade and final grade.
# passingGrade = midterm * (0.3) + project * (0.3) + final * (0.4) passing grade should be determined like this.
# Create a dictionary that keeps these studentsâ€™ information.
# Calculate the studentsâ€™ grades and transfer them to the list with the help of indexing.
# Finally, set the student with the highest grade to be in the first index and the student
# with the lowest grade to be in the last index of the list.


#Comment: used way too many variables, would appreciate feedback on other ways involving lesser variable declarations.
