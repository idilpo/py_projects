# Final Project â€“ Knowledge Competition
# The program should consist of 10 questions in total, each question having only one correct answer.
# Adjust the answers of the questions according to case sensitivity.
# Each question should be worth 10 points.
# If the user answers 5 or fewer questions, they will be considered unsuccessful.
# If the user answers more than 5 questions correctly, they will be considered successful.

# STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!!!
