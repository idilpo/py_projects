	<div class="act">
	<h3>SCENE I. Rome. A street.</h3>

	<i>Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners</i>

	<p class="speaker">FLAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:</p>
	<p class="line">Is this a holiday? what! know you not,</p>
	<p class="line">Being mechanical, you ought not walk</p>
	<p class="line">Upon a labouring day without the sign</p>
	<p class="line">Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?</p>

	<p class="speaker">First Commoner</p>
	<p class="line">Why, sir, a carpenter.</p>

	<p class="speaker">MARULLUS</p>
	<p class="line">Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?</p>
	<p class="line">What dost thou with thy best apparel on?</p>
	<p class="line">You, sir, what trade are you?</p>

	<p class="speaker">Second Commoner</p>
	<p class="line">Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,</p>
	<p class="line">as you would say, a cobbler.</p>

	<p class="speaker">MARULLUS</p>
	<p class="line">But what trade art thou? answer me directly.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Second Commoner</p>
	<p class="line">A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe</p>
	<p class="line">conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.</p>

	<p class="speaker">MARULLUS</p>
	<p class="line">What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?</p>

	<p class="speaker">Second Commoner</p>
	<p class="line">Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,</p>
	<p class="line">if you be out, sir, I can mend you.</p>

	<p class="speaker">MARULLUS</p>
	<p class="line">What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!</p>

	<p class="speaker">Second Commoner</p>
	<p class="line">Why, sir, cobble you.</p>

	<p class="speaker">FLAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Thou art a cobbler, art thou?</p>

	<p class="speaker">Second Commoner</p>
	<p class="line">Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I</p>
	<p class="line">meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's</p>
	<p class="line">matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon</p>
	<p class="line">to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I</p>
	<p class="line">recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon</p>
	<p class="line">neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.</p>

	<p class="speaker">FLAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">But wherefore art not in thy shop today?</p>
	<p class="line">Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?</p>

	<p class="speaker">Second Commoner</p>
	<p class="line">Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself</p>
	<p class="line">into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,</p>
	<p class="line">to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.</p>

	<p class="speaker">MARULLUS</p>
	<p class="line">Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?</p>
	<p class="line">What tributaries follow him to Rome,</p>
	<p class="line">To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?</p>
	<p class="line">You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!</p>
	<p class="line">O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,</p>
	<p class="line">Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft</p>
	<p class="line">Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,</p>
	<p class="line">To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,</p>
	<p class="line">Your infants in your arms, and there have sat</p>
	<p class="line">The livelong day, with patient expectation,</p>
	<p class="line">To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:</p>
	<p class="line">And when you saw his chariot but appear,</p>
	<p class="line">Have you not made an universal shout,</p>
	<p class="line">That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,</p>
	<p class="line">To hear the replication of your sounds</p>
	<p class="line">Made in her concave shores?</p>
	<p class="line">And do you now put on your best attire?</p>
	<p class="line">And do you now cull out a holiday?</p>
	<p class="line">And do you now strew flowers in his way</p>
	<p class="line">That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!</p>
	<p class="line">Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,</p>
	<p class="line">Pray to the gods to intermit the plague</p>
	<p class="line">That needs must light on this ingratitude.</p>

	<p class="speaker">FLAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,</p>
	<p class="line">Assemble all the poor men of your sort;</p>
	<p class="line">Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears</p>
	<p class="line">Into the channel, till the lowest stream</p>
	<p class="line">Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.</p>

	<p><i>Exeunt all the Commoners</i></p>
	<p class="line">See whether their basest metal be not moved;</p>
	<p class="line">They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.</p>
	<p class="line">Go you down that way towards the Capitol;</p>
	<p class="line">This way will I</p>
	<p class="line">disrobe the images,</p>
	<p class="line">If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.</p>

	<p class="speaker">MARULLUS</p>
	<p class="line">May we do so?</p>
	<p class="line">You know it is the feast of Lupercal.</p>

	<p class="speaker">FLAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">It is no matter; let no images</p>
	<p class="line">Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,</p>
	<p class="line">And drive away the vulgar from the streets:</p>
	<p class="line">So do you too, where you perceive them thick.</p>
	<p class="line">These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing</p>
	<p class="line">Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,</p>
	<p class="line">Who else would soar above the view of men</p>
	<p class="line">And keep us all in servile fearfulness.</p>
	<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>

	<h3>SCENE II. A public place.</h3>

	<i>Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;  CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer</i>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Calpurnia!</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">         Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Calpurnia!</p>

	<p class="speaker">CALPURNIA</p>
	<p class="line">Here, my lord.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Stand you directly in Antonius' way,</p>
	<p class="line">When he doth run his course. Antonius!</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar, my lord?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,</p>
	<p class="line">To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,</p>
	<p class="line">The barren, touched in this holy chase,</p>
	<p class="line">Shake off their sterile curse.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">I shall remember:</p>
	<p class="line">When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Set on; and leave no ceremony out.</p>
	<p><i>Flourish</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar!</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Ha! who calls?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Who is it in the press that calls on me?</p>
	<p class="line">I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,</p>
	<p class="line">Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
	<p class="line">Beware the ides of March.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">What man is that?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Set him before me; let me see his face.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
	<p class="line">Beware the ides of March.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.</p>
	<p><i>Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Will you go see the order of the course?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Not I.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">I pray you, do.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">I am not gamesome: I do lack some part</p>
	<p class="line">Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.</p>
	<p class="line">Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;</p>
	<p class="line">I'll leave you.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Brutus, I do observe you now of late:</p>
	<p class="line">I have not from your eyes that gentleness</p>
	<p class="line">And show of love as I was wont to have:</p>
	<p class="line">You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</p>
	<p class="line">Over your friend that loves you.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Cassius,</p>
	<p class="line">Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,</p>
	<p class="line">I turn the trouble of my countenance</p>
	<p class="line">Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</p>
	<p class="line">Of late with passions of some difference,</p>
	<p class="line">Conceptions only proper to myself,</p>
	<p class="line">Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</p>
	<p class="line">But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--</p>
	<p class="line">Among which number, Cassius, be you one--</p>
	<p class="line">Nor construe any further my neglect,</p>
	<p class="line">Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</p>
	<p class="line">Forgets the shows of love to other men.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;</p>
	<p class="line">By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</p>
	<p class="line">Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</p>
	<p class="line">Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,</p>
	<p class="line">But by reflection, by some other things.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">'Tis just:</p>
	<p class="line">And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</p>
	<p class="line">That you have no such mirrors as will turn</p>
	<p class="line">Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</p>
	<p class="line">That you might see your shadow. I have heard,</p>
	<p class="line">Where many of the best respect in Rome,</p>
	<p class="line">Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</p>
	<p class="line">And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</p>
	<p class="line">Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</p>
	<p class="line">That you would have me seek into myself</p>
	<p class="line">For that which is not in me?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:</p>
	<p class="line">And since you know you cannot see yourself</p>
	<p class="line">So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</p>
	<p class="line">Will modestly discover to yourself</p>
	<p class="line">That of yourself which you yet know not of.</p>
	<p class="line">And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</p>
	<p class="line">Were I a common laugher, or did use</p>
	<p class="line">To stale with ordinary oaths my love</p>
	<p class="line">To every new protester; if you know</p>
	<p class="line">That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</p>
	<p class="line">And after scandal them, or if you know</p>
	<p class="line">That I profess myself in banqueting</p>
	<p class="line">To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</p>
	<p><i>Flourish, and shout</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">What means this shouting? I do fear, the people</p>
	<p class="line">Choose Caesar for their king.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Ay, do you fear it?</p>
	<p class="line">Then must I think you would not have it so.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.</p>
	<p class="line">But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</p>
	<p class="line">What is it that you would impart to me?</p>
	<p class="line">If it be aught toward the general good,</p>
	<p class="line">Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,</p>
	<p class="line">And I will look on both indifferently,</p>
	<p class="line">For let the gods so speed me as I love</p>
	<p class="line">The name of honour more than I fear death.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</p>
	<p class="line">As well as I do know your outward favour.</p>
	<p class="line">Well, honour is the subject of my story.</p>
	<p class="line">I cannot tell what you and other men</p>
	<p class="line">Think of this life; but, for my single self,</p>
	<p class="line">I had as lief not be as live to be</p>
	<p class="line">In awe of such a thing as I myself.</p>
	<p class="line">I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</p>
	<p class="line">We both have fed as well, and we can both</p>
	<p class="line">Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</p>
	<p class="line">For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</p>
	<p class="line">The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</p>
	<p class="line">Leap in with me into this angry flood,</p>
	<p class="line">And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</p>
	<p class="line">Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</p>
	<p class="line">And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</p>
	<p class="line">The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</p>
	<p class="line">With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</p>
	<p class="line">And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</p>
	<p class="line">But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</p>
	<p class="line">I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</p>
	<p class="line">Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</p>
	<p class="line">The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</p>
	<p class="line">Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</p>
	<p class="line">Is now become a god, and Cassius is</p>
	<p class="line">A wretched creature and must bend his body,</p>
	<p class="line">If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</p>
	<p class="line">He had a fever when he was in Spain,</p>
	<p class="line">And when the fit was on him, I did mark</p>
	<p class="line">How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;</p>
	<p class="line">His coward lips did from their colour fly,</p>
	<p class="line">And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</p>
	<p class="line">Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</p>
	<p class="line">Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</p>
	<p class="line">Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</p>
	<p class="line">Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</p>
	<p class="line">As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</p>
	<p class="line">A man of such a feeble temper should</p>
	<p class="line">So get the start of the majestic world</p>
	<p class="line">And bear the palm alone.</p>
	<p><i>Shout. Flourish</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Another general shout!</p>
	<p class="line">I do believe that these applauses are</p>
	<p class="line">For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</p>
	<p class="line">Like a Colossus, and we petty men</p>
	<p class="line">Walk under his huge legs and peep about</p>
	<p class="line">To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</p>
	<p class="line">Men at some time are masters of their fates:</p>
	<p class="line">The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</p>
	<p class="line">But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</p>
	<p class="line">Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?</p>
	<p class="line">Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</p>
	<p class="line">Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</p>
	<p class="line">Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</p>
	<p class="line">Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,</p>
	<p class="line">Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.</p>
	<p class="line">Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</p>
	<p class="line">Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</p>
	<p class="line">That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</p>
	<p class="line">Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</p>
	<p class="line">When went there by an age, since the great flood,</p>
	<p class="line">But it was famed with more than with one man?</p>
	<p class="line">When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,</p>
	<p class="line">That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?</p>
	<p class="line">Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</p>
	<p class="line">When there is in it but one only man.</p>
	<p class="line">O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</p>
	<p class="line">There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd</p>
	<p class="line">The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</p>
	<p class="line">As easily as a king.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</p>
	<p class="line">What you would work me to, I have some aim:</p>
	<p class="line">How I have thought of this and of these times,</p>
	<p class="line">I shall recount hereafter; for this present,</p>
	<p class="line">I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</p>
	<p class="line">Be any further moved. What you have said</p>
	<p class="line">I will consider; what you have to say</p>
	<p class="line">I will with patience hear, and find a time</p>
	<p class="line">Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</p>
	<p class="line">Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</p>
	<p class="line">Brutus had rather be a villager</p>
	<p class="line">Than to repute himself a son of Rome</p>
	<p class="line">Under these hard conditions as this time</p>
	<p class="line">Is like to lay upon us.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">I am glad that my weak words</p>
	<p class="line">Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">The games are done and Caesar is returning.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;</p>
	<p class="line">And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you</p>
	<p class="line">What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.</p>
	<p><i>Re-enter CAESAR and his Train</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,</p>
	<p class="line">The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,</p>
	<p class="line">And all the rest look like a chidden train:</p>
	<p class="line">Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero</p>
	<p class="line">Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</p>
	<p class="line">As we have seen him in the Capitol,</p>
	<p class="line">Being cross'd in conference by some senators.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Casca will tell us what the matter is.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Antonius!</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Let me have men about me that are fat;</p>
	<p class="line">Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:</p>
	<p class="line">Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;</p>
	<p class="line">He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;</p>
	<p class="line">He is a noble Roman and well given.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:</p>
	<p class="line">Yet if my name were liable to fear,</p>
	<p class="line">I do not know the man I should avoid</p>
	<p class="line">So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;</p>
	<p class="line">He is a great observer and he looks</p>
	<p class="line">Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,</p>
	<p class="line">As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;</p>
	<p class="line">Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort</p>
	<p class="line">As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit</p>
	<p class="line">That could be moved to smile at any thing.</p>
	<p class="line">Such men as he be never at heart's ease</p>
	<p class="line">Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,</p>
	<p class="line">And therefore are they very dangerous.</p>
	<p class="line">I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd</p>
	<p class="line">Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.</p>
	<p class="line">Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,</p>
	<p class="line">And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.</p>
	<p><i>Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,</p>
	<p class="line">That Caesar looks so sad.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Why, you were with him, were you not?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Why, there was a crown offered him: and being</p>
	<p class="line">offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,</p>
	<p class="line">thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">What was the second noise for?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Why, for that too.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Why, for that too.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Was the crown offered him thrice?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every</p>
	<p class="line">time gentler than other, and at every putting-by</p>
	<p class="line">mine honest neighbours shouted.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Who offered him the crown?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Why, Antony.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:</p>
	<p class="line">it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark</p>
	<p class="line">Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown</p>
	<p class="line">neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told</p>
	<p class="line">you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my</p>
	<p class="line">thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he</p>
	<p class="line">offered it to him again; then he put it by again:</p>
	<p class="line">but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his</p>
	<p class="line">fingers off it. And then he offered it the third</p>
	<p class="line">time; he put it the third time by: and still as he</p>
	<p class="line">refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their</p>
	<p class="line">chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps</p>
	<p class="line">and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and</p>
	<p class="line">for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of</p>
	<p class="line">opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at</p>
	<p class="line">mouth, and was speechless.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,</p>
	<p class="line">And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not</p>
	<p class="line">clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and</p>
	<p class="line">displeased them, as they use to do the players in</p>
	<p class="line">the theatre, I am no true man.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">What said he when he came unto himself?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the</p>
	<p class="line">common herd was glad he refused the crown, he</p>
	<p class="line">plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his</p>
	<p class="line">throat to cut. An I had been a man of any</p>
	<p class="line">occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,</p>
	<p class="line">I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so</p>
	<p class="line">he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,</p>
	<p class="line">If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired</p>
	<p class="line">their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three</p>
	<p class="line">or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good</p>
	<p class="line">soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but</p>
	<p class="line">there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had</p>
	<p class="line">stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">And after that, he came, thus sad, away?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Ay.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Did Cicero say any thing?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Ay, he spoke Greek.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">To what effect?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the</p>
	<p class="line">face again: but those that understood him smiled at</p>
	<p class="line">one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own</p>
	<p class="line">part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more</p>
	<p class="line">news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs</p>
	<p class="line">off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you</p>
	<p class="line">well. There was more foolery yet, if I could</p>
	<p class="line">remember it.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">No, I am promised forth.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Will you dine with me to-morrow?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner</p>
	<p class="line">worth the eating.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Good: I will expect you.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Do so. Farewell, both.</p>
	<p><i>Exit</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!</p>
	<p class="line">He was quick mettle when he went to school.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">So is he now in execution</p>
	<p class="line">Of any bold or noble enterprise,</p>
	<p class="line">However he puts on this tardy form.</p>
	<p class="line">This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,</p>
	<p class="line">Which gives men stomach to digest his words</p>
	<p class="line">With better appetite.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">And so it is. For this time I will leave you:</p>
	<p class="line">To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,</p>
	<p class="line">I will come home to you; or, if you will,</p>
	<p class="line">Come home to me, and I will wait for you.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">I will do so: till then, think of the world.</p>
	<p><i>Exit BRUTUS</i></p>
	<p class="line">Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,</p>
	<p class="line">Thy honourable metal may be wrought</p>
	<p class="line">From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet</p>
	<p class="line">That noble minds keep ever with their likes;</p>
	<p class="line">For who so firm that cannot be seduced?</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:</p>
	<p class="line">If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,</p>
	<p class="line">He should not humour me. I will this night,</p>
	<p class="line">In several hands, in at his windows throw,</p>
	<p class="line">As if they came from several citizens,</p>
	<p class="line">Writings all tending to the great opinion</p>
	<p class="line">That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:</p>
	<p class="line">And after this let Caesar seat him sure;</p>
	<p class="line">For we will shake him, or worse days endure.</p>
	<p><i>Exit</i></p>

	<h3>SCENE III. The same. A street.</h3>

	<i>Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides, CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO</i>

	<p class="speaker">CICERO</p>
	<p class="line">Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?</p>
	<p class="line">Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth</p>
	<p class="line">Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,</p>
	<p class="line">I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds</p>
	<p class="line">Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen</p>
	<p class="line">The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,</p>
	<p class="line">To be exalted with the threatening clouds:</p>
	<p class="line">But never till to-night, never till now,</p>
	<p class="line">Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.</p>
	<p class="line">Either there is a civil strife in heaven,</p>
	<p class="line">Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,</p>
	<p class="line">Incenses them to send destruction.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CICERO</p>
	<p class="line">Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">A common slave--you know him well by sight--</p>
	<p class="line">Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn</p>
	<p class="line">Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,</p>
	<p class="line">Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.</p>
	<p class="line">Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--</p>
	<p class="line">Against the Capitol I met a lion,</p>
	<p class="line">Who glared upon me, and went surly by,</p>
	<p class="line">Without annoying me: and there were drawn</p>
	<p class="line">Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,</p>
	<p class="line">Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw</p>
	<p class="line">Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.</p>
	<p class="line">And yesterday the bird of night did sit</p>
	<p class="line">Even at noon-day upon the market-place,</p>
	<p class="line">Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies</p>
	<p class="line">Do so conjointly meet, let not men say</p>
	<p class="line">'These are their reasons; they are natural;'</p>
	<p class="line">For, I believe, they are portentous things</p>
	<p class="line">Unto the climate that they point upon.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CICERO</p>
	<p class="line">Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:</p>
	<p class="line">But men may construe things after their fashion,</p>
	<p class="line">Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.</p>
	<p class="line">Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">He doth; for he did bid Antonius</p>
	<p class="line">Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CICERO</p>
	<p class="line">Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky</p>
	<p class="line">Is not to walk in.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Farewell, Cicero.</p>
	<p><i>Exit CICERO</i></p>
	<p><i>Enter CASSIUS</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Who's there?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">                  A Roman.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Casca, by your voice.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">A very pleasing night to honest men.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Who ever knew the heavens menace so?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Those that have known the earth so full of faults.</p>
	<p class="line">For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,</p>
	<p class="line">Submitting me unto the perilous night,</p>
	<p class="line">And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,</p>
	<p class="line">Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;</p>
	<p class="line">And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open</p>
	<p class="line">The breast of heaven, I did present myself</p>
	<p class="line">Even in the aim and very flash of it.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?</p>
	<p class="line">It is the part of men to fear and tremble,</p>
	<p class="line">When the most mighty gods by tokens send</p>
	<p class="line">Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life</p>
	<p class="line">That should be in a Roman you do want,</p>
	<p class="line">Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze</p>
	<p class="line">And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,</p>
	<p class="line">To see the strange impatience of the heavens:</p>
	<p class="line">But if you would consider the true cause</p>
	<p class="line">Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,</p>
	<p class="line">Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,</p>
	<p class="line">Why old men fool and children calculate,</p>
	<p class="line">Why all these things change from their ordinance</p>
	<p class="line">Their natures and preformed faculties</p>
	<p class="line">To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find</p>
	<p class="line">That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,</p>
	<p class="line">To make them instruments of fear and warning</p>
	<p class="line">Unto some monstrous state.</p>
	<p class="line">Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man</p>
	<p class="line">Most like this dreadful night,</p>
	<p class="line">That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars</p>
	<p class="line">As doth the lion in the Capitol,</p>
	<p class="line">A man no mightier than thyself or me</p>
	<p class="line">In personal action, yet prodigious grown</p>
	<p class="line">And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Let it be who it is: for Romans now</p>
	<p class="line">Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;</p>
	<p class="line">But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,</p>
	<p class="line">And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;</p>
	<p class="line">Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow</p>
	<p class="line">Mean to establish Caesar as a king;</p>
	<p class="line">And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,</p>
	<p class="line">In every place, save here in Italy.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">I know where I will wear this dagger then;</p>
	<p class="line">Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:</p>
	<p class="line">Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;</p>
	<p class="line">Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:</p>
	<p class="line">Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,</p>
	<p class="line">Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,</p>
	<p class="line">Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;</p>
	<p class="line">But life, being weary of these worldly bars,</p>
	<p class="line">Never lacks power to dismiss itself.</p>
	<p class="line">If I know this, know all the world besides,</p>
	<p class="line">That part of tyranny that I do bear</p>
	<p class="line">I can shake off at pleasure.</p>
	<p><i>Thunder still</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">So can I:</p>
	<p class="line">So every bondman in his own hand bears</p>
	<p class="line">The power to cancel his captivity.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?</p>
	<p class="line">Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,</p>
	<p class="line">But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:</p>
	<p class="line">He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.</p>
	<p class="line">Those that with haste will make a mighty fire</p>
	<p class="line">Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,</p>
	<p class="line">What rubbish and what offal, when it serves</p>
	<p class="line">For the base matter to illuminate</p>
	<p class="line">So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,</p>
	<p class="line">Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this</p>
	<p class="line">Before a willing bondman; then I know</p>
	<p class="line">My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,</p>
	<p class="line">And dangers are to me indifferent.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">You speak to Casca, and to such a man</p>
	<p class="line">That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:</p>
	<p class="line">Be factious for redress of all these griefs,</p>
	<p class="line">And I will set this foot of mine as far</p>
	<p class="line">As who goes farthest.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">There's a bargain made.</p>
	<p class="line">Now know you, Casca, I have moved already</p>
	<p class="line">Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans</p>
	<p class="line">To undergo with me an enterprise</p>
	<p class="line">Of honourable-dangerous consequence;</p>
	<p class="line">And I do know, by this, they stay for me</p>
	<p class="line">In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,</p>
	<p class="line">There is no stir or walking in the streets;</p>
	<p class="line">And the complexion of the element</p>
	<p class="line">In favour's like the work we have in hand,</p>
	<p class="line">Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;</p>
	<p class="line">He is a friend.</p>
	<p><i>Enter CINNA</i></p>
	<p class="line">Cinna, where haste you so?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CINNA</p>
	<p class="line">To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">No, it is Casca; one incorporate</p>
	<p class="line">To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CINNA</p>
	<p class="line">I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!</p>
	<p class="line">There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Am I not stay'd for? tell me.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CINNA</p>
	<p class="line">Yes, you are.</p>
	<p class="line">O Cassius, if you could</p>
	<p class="line">But win the noble Brutus to our party--</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,</p>
	<p class="line">And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,</p>
	<p class="line">Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this</p>
	<p class="line">In at his window; set this up with wax</p>
	<p class="line">Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,</p>
	<p class="line">Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.</p>
	<p class="line">Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CINNA</p>
	<p class="line">All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone</p>
	<p class="line">To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,</p>
	<p class="line">And so bestow these papers as you bade me.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.</p>
	<p><i>Exit CINNA</i></p>
	<p class="line">Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day</p>
	<p class="line">See Brutus at his house: three parts of him</p>
	<p class="line">Is ours already, and the man entire</p>
	<p class="line">Upon the next encounter yields him ours.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASCA</p>
	<p class="line">O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:</p>
	<p class="line">And that which would appear offence in us,</p>
	<p class="line">His countenance, like richest alchemy,</p>
	<p class="line">Will change to virtue and to worthiness.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Him and his worth and our great need of him</p>
	<p class="line">You have right well conceited. Let us go,</p>

	<i>Enter BRUTUS</i>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">What, Lucius, ho!</p>
	<p class="line">I cannot, by the progress of the stars,</p>

	<p class="line">I will, my lord.</p>

	<p class="line">It must be by his death: and for my part,</p>
	<p class="line">I know no personal cause to spurn at him,</p>
	<p class="line">But for the general. He would be crown'd:</p>
	<p class="line">How that might change his nature, there's the question.</p>
	<p class="line">It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;</p>
	<p class="line">And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--</p>
	<p class="line">And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,</p>
	<p class="line">That at his will he may do danger with.</p>

	<p class="line">Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,</p>
	<p class="line">I have not known when his affections sway'd</p>
	<p class="line">More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,</p>
	<p class="line">That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,</p>
	<p class="line">Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;</p>
	<p class="line">But when he once attains the upmost round.</p>
	<p class="line">He then unto the ladder turns his back,</p>
	<p class="line">Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</p>
	<p class="line">By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.</p>
	<p class="line">Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel</p>
	<p class="line">Will bear no colour for the thing he is,</p>
	<p class="line">Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,</p>
	<p class="line">Would run to these and these extremities:</p>
	<p class="line">And therefore think him as a serpent's egg</p>
	<p class="line">Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,</p>

	<p class="line">Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?</p>

	<p class="speaker">LIGARIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,</p>
	<p class="line">To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!</p>

	<p class="speaker">LIGARIUS</p>
	<p class="line">I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand</p>
	<p class="line">Any exploit worthy the name of honour.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,</p>
	<p class="line">Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.</p>

	<p class="speaker">LIGARIUS</p>
	<p class="line">By all the gods that Romans bow before,</p>
	<p class="line">I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!</p>
	<p class="line">Brave son, derived from honourable loins!</p>
	<p class="line">Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up</p>
	<p class="line">My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,</p>
	<p class="line">And I will strive with things impossible;</p>
	<p class="line">Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">A piece of work that will make sick men whole.</p>

	<p class="speaker">LIGARIUS</p>
	<p class="line">But are not some whole that we must make sick?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">That must we also. What it is, my Caius,</p>
	<p class="line">I shall unfold to thee, as we are going</p>
	<p class="line">To whom it must be done.</p>

	<p class="speaker">LIGARIUS</p>

	<p class="line">And with a heart new-fired I follow you,</p>
	<p class="line">To do I know not what: but it sufficeth</p>
	<p class="line">That Brutus leads me on.</p>

	<h3>SCENE II. CAESAR's house.</h3>

	<i>Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his night-gown</i>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:</p>
	<p class="line">Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,</p>
	<p class="line">'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?</p>
	<p><i>Enter a Servant</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
	<p class="line">My lord?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Go bid the priests do present sacrifice</p>
	<p class="line">And bring me their opinions of success.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
	<p class="line">I will, my lord.</p>
	<p><i>Exit</i></p>
	<p><i>Enter CALPURNIA</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">CALPURNIA</p>
	<p class="line">What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?</p>
	<p class="line">You shall not stir out of your house to-day.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me</p>
	<p class="line">Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see</p>
	<p class="line">The face of Caesar, they are vanished.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CALPURNIA</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,</p>
	<p class="line">Yet now they fright me. There is one within,</p>
	<p class="line">Besides the things that we have heard and seen,</p>
	<p class="line">Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.</p>
	<p class="line">A lioness hath whelped in the streets;</p>
	<p class="line">And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;</p>
	<p class="line">Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,</p>
	<p class="line">In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,</p>
	<p class="line">Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;</p>
	<p class="line">The noise of battle hurtled in the air,</p>
	<p class="line">Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,</p>
	<p class="line">And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.</p>
	<p class="line">O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,</p>
	<p class="line">And I do fear them.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">What can be avoided</p>
	<p class="line">Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?</p>
	<p class="line">Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions</p>
	<p class="line">Are to the world in general as to Caesar.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CALPURNIA</p>
	<p class="line">When beggars die, there are no comets seen;</p>
	<p class="line">The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Cowards die many times before their deaths;</p>
	<p class="line">The valiant never taste of death but once.</p>
	<p class="line">Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.</p>
	<p class="line">It seems to me most strange that men should fear;</p>
	<p class="line">Seeing that death, a necessary end,</p>
	<p class="line">Will come when it will come.</p>
	<p><i>Re-enter Servant</i></p>
	<p class="line">What say the augurers?</p>

	<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
	<p class="line">They would not have you to stir forth to-day.</p>
	<p class="line">Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,</p>
	<p class="line">They could not find a heart within the beast.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">The gods do this in shame of cowardice:</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar should be a beast without a heart,</p>
	<p class="line">If he should stay at home to-day for fear.</p>
	<p class="line">No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well</p>
	<p class="line">That Caesar is more dangerous than he:</p>
	<p class="line">We are two lions litter'd in one day,</p>
	<p class="line">And I the elder and more terrible:</p>
	<p class="line">And Caesar shall go forth.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CALPURNIA</p>
	<p class="line">Alas, my lord,</p>
	<p class="line">Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.</p>
	<p class="line">Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear</p>
	<p class="line">That keeps you in the house, and not your own.</p>
	<p class="line">We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:</p>
	<p class="line">And he shall say you are not well to-day:</p>
	<p class="line">Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">Mark Antony shall say I am not well,</p>
	<p class="line">And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.</p>
	<p><i>Enter DECIUS BRUTUS</i></p>
	<p class="line">Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.</p>

	<p class="speaker">DECIUS BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:</p>
	<p class="line">I come to fetch you to the senate-house.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">And you are come in very happy time,</p>
	<p class="line">To bear my greeting to the senators</p>
	<p class="line">And tell them that I will not come to-day:</p>
	<p class="line">Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:</p>
	<p class="line">I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CALPURNIA</p>
	<p class="line">Say he is sick.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">                  Shall Caesar send a lie?</p>
	<p class="line">Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,</p>
	<p class="line">To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?</p>
	<p class="line">Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.</p>

	<p class="speaker">DECIUS BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,</p>
	<p class="line">Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">The cause is in my will: I will not come;</p>
	<p class="line">That is enough to satisfy the senate.</p>
	<p class="line">But for your private satisfaction,</p>
	<p class="line">Because I love you, I will let you know:</p>
	<p class="line">Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:</p>
	<p class="line">She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,</p>
	<p class="line">Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,</p>
	<p class="line">Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans</p>
	<p class="line">Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:</p>
	<p class="line">And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,</p>
	<p class="line">And evils imminent; and on her knee</p>
	<p class="line">Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.</p>

	<p class="speaker">DECIUS BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">This dream is all amiss interpreted;</p>
	<p class="line">It was a vision fair and fortunate:</p>
	<p class="line">Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,</p>
	<p class="line">In which so many smiling Romans bathed,</p>
	<p class="line">Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck</p>
	<p class="line">Reviving blood, and that great men shall press</p>
	<p class="line">For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.</p>
	<p class="line">This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">And this way have you well expounded it.</p>

	<p class="speaker">DECIUS BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">I have, when you have heard what I can say:</p>
	<p class="line">And know it now: the senate have concluded</p>
	<p class="line">To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.</p>
	<p class="line">If you shall send them word you will not come,</p>
	<p class="line">Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock</p>
	<p class="line">Apt to be render'd, for some one to say</p>
	<p class="line">'Break up the senate till another time,</p>
	<p class="line">When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'</p>
	<p class="line">If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper</p>
	<p class="line">'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?</p>
	<p class="line">Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love</p>
	<p class="line">To our proceeding bids me tell you this;</p>
	<p class="line">And reason to my love is liable.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CAESAR</p>
	<p class="line">How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!</p>
	<p class="line">I am ashamed I did yield to them.</p>
	<p class="line">Give me my robe, for I will go.</p>
	<p><i>Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA, TREBONIUS, and CINNA</i></p>

	<p class="line">Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,</p>

	<p class="line">Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!</p>
	<p class="line">I have an hour's talk in store for you;</p>

	<p class="line">As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,</p>

	<p class="line">And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.</p>
	<p class="line">How like a deer, strucken by many princes,</p>
	<p class="line">Dost thou here lie!</p>

	<p class="line">Mark Antony,--</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">                  Pardon me, Caius Cassius:</p>
	<p class="line">The enemies of Caesar shall say this;</p>
	<p class="line">Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">I blame you not for praising Caesar so;</p>

	<p class="line">Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,</p>

	<p class="line">About his funeral: and you shall speak</p>

	<p class="line">his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not</p>
	<p class="line">extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences</p>
	<p class="line">enforced, for which he suffered death.</p>
	<p><i>Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body</i></p>

	<p class="line">though he had no hand in his death, shall receive</p>
	<p class="line">the benefit of his dying, a place in the</p>
	<p class="line">commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this</p>
	<p class="line">I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the</p>

	<p class="line">And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:</p>
	<p class="line">Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech</p>
	<p class="line">Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,</p>

	<p class="line">We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.</p>
	<p><i>Goes into the pulpit</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">What does he say of Brutus?</p>

	<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">He says, for Brutus' sake,</p>
	<p class="line">He finds himself beholding to us all.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.</p>

	<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">This Caesar was a tyrant.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">Nay, that's certain:</p>
	<p class="line">We are blest that Rome is rid of him.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">You gentle Romans,--</p>

	<p class="speaker">Citizens</p>
	<p class="line">Peace, ho! let us hear him.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;</p>
	<p class="line">I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</p>
	<p class="line">The evil that men do lives after them;</p>
	<p class="line">The good is oft interred with their bones;</p>
	<p class="line">So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</p>
	<p class="line">Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:</p>
	<p class="line">If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</p>
	<p class="line">And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.</p>
	<p class="line">Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--</p>
	<p class="line">For Brutus is an honourable man;</p>
	<p class="line">So are they all, all honourable men--</p>
	<p class="line">Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.</p>
	<p class="line">He was my friend, faithful and just to me:</p>
	<p class="line">But Brutus says he was ambitious;</p>
	<p class="line">And Brutus is an honourable man.</p>
	<p class="line">He hath brought many captives home to Rome</p>
	<p class="line">Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:</p>
	<p class="line">Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</p>
	<p class="line">When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:</p>
	<p class="line">Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</p>
	<p class="line">Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</p>
	<p class="line">And Brutus is an honourable man.</p>
	<p class="line">You all did see that on the Lupercal</p>
	<p class="line">I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</p>
	<p class="line">Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?</p>
	<p class="line">Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</p>
	<p class="line">And, sure, he is an honourable man.</p>
	<p class="line">I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</p>
	<p class="line">But here I am to speak what I do know.</p>
	<p class="line">You all did love him once, not without cause:</p>
	<p class="line">What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?</p>
	<p class="line">O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,</p>
	<p class="line">And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;</p>
	<p class="line">My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</p>
	<p class="line">And I must pause till it come back to me.</p>

	<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">If thou consider rightly of the matter,</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar has had great wrong.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">Has he, masters?</p>
	<p class="line">I fear there will a worse come in his place.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;</p>
	<p class="line">Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.</p>

	<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">If it be found so, some will dear abide it.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">Now mark him, he begins again to speak.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">But yesterday the word of Caesar might</p>
	<p class="line">Have stood against the world; now lies he there.</p>
	<p class="line">And none so poor to do him reverence.</p>
	<p class="line">O masters, if I were disposed to stir</p>
	<p class="line">Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</p>
	<p class="line">I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,</p>
	<p class="line">Who, you all know, are honourable men:</p>
	<p class="line">I will not do them wrong; I rather choose</p>
	<p class="line">To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,</p>
	<p class="line">Than I will wrong such honourable men.</p>
	<p class="line">But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;</p>
	<p class="line">I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:</p>
	<p class="line">Let but the commons hear this testament--</p>
	<p class="line">Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--</p>
	<p class="line">And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds</p>
	<p class="line">And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,</p>
	<p class="line">Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,</p>
	<p class="line">And, dying, mention it within their wills,</p>
	<p class="line">Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</p>
	<p class="line">Unto their issue.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.</p>

	<p class="speaker">All</p>
	<p class="line">The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;</p>
	<p class="line">It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.</p>
	<p class="line">You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;</p>
	<p class="line">And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,</p>
	<p class="line">It will inflame you, it will make you mad:</p>
	<p class="line">'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;</p>
	<p class="line">For, if you should, O, what would come of it!</p>

	<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;</p>
	<p class="line">You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?</p>
	<p class="line">I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:</p>
	<p class="line">I fear I wrong the honourable men</p>
	<p class="line">Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">They were traitors: honourable men!</p>

	<p class="speaker">All</p>
	<p class="line">The will! the testament!</p>

	<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">You will compel me, then, to read the will?</p>
	<p class="line">Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,</p>
	<p class="line">And let me show you him that made the will.</p>
	<p class="line">Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?</p>

	<p class="speaker">Several Citizens</p>
	<p class="line">Come down.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">Descend.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">You shall have leave.</p>
	<p><i>ANTONY comes down</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
	<p class="line">Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.</p>

	<p class="speaker">Several Citizens</p>
	<p class="line">Stand back; room; bear back.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.</p>
	<p class="line">You all do know this mantle: I remember</p>
	<p class="line">The first time ever Caesar put it on;</p>
	<p class="line">'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,</p>
	<p class="line">That day he overcame the Nervii:</p>
	<p class="line">Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:</p>
	<p class="line">See what a rent the envious Casca made:</p>
	<p class="line">Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;</p>
	<p class="line">And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,</p>
	<p class="line">Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,</p>
	<p class="line">As rushing out of doors, to be resolved</p>
	<p class="line">If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;</p>
	<p class="line">For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:</p>
	<p class="line">Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</p>
	<p class="line">This was the most unkindest cut of all;</p>
	<p class="line">For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</p>
	<p class="line">Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,</p>
	<p class="line">Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;</p>
	<p class="line">And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</p>
	<p class="line">Even at the base of Pompey's statua,</p>
	<p class="line">Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.</p>
	<p class="line">O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</p>
	<p class="line">Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,</p>
	<p class="line">Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.</p>
	<p class="line">O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel</p>
	<p class="line">The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.</p>
	<p class="line">Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold</p>
	<p class="line">Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,</p>
	<p class="line">Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.</p>

	<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>

	<p class="line">Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up</p>

	<p class="line">They that have done this deed are honourable:</p>
	<p class="line">What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,</p>

	<p class="line">I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:</p>

	<p class="line">That love my friend; and that they know full well</p>

	<p class="line">For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,</p>
	<p class="line">Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,</p>
	<p class="line">To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;</p>
	<p class="line">I tell you that which you yourselves do know;</p>
	<p class="line">Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,</p>
	<p class="line">And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,</p>
	<p class="line">And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony</p>
	<p class="line">Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue</p>

	<p class="line">Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.</p>
	<p class="line">But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;</p>
	<p class="line">Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine</p>
	<p class="line">How to cut off some charge in legacies.</p>

	<p class="speaker">LEPIDUS</p>
	<p class="line">What, shall I find you here?</p>

	<p class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Or here, or at the Capitol.</p>
	<p><i>Exit LEPIDUS</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">This is a slight unmeritable man,</p>
	<p class="line">Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,</p>
	<p class="line">The three-fold world divided, he should stand</p>
	<p class="line">One of the three to share it?</p>

	<p class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">So you thought him;</p>
	<p class="line">And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,</p>
	<p class="line">In our black sentence and proscription.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">Octavius, I have seen more days than you:</p>
	<p class="line">And though we lay these honours on this man,</p>
	<p class="line">To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,</p>
	<p class="line">He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,</p>
	<p class="line">To groan and sweat under the business,</p>
	<p class="line">Either led or driven, as we point the way;</p>
	<p class="line">And having brought our treasure where we will,</p>
	<p class="line">Then take we down his load, and turn him off,</p>
	<p class="line">Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,</p>
	<p class="line">And graze in commons.</p>

	<p class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">You may do your will;</p>
	<p class="line">But he's a tried and valiant soldier.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">So is my horse, Octavius; and for that</p>
	<p class="line">I do appoint him store of provender:</p>
	<p class="line">It is a creature that I teach to fight,</p>
	<p class="line">To wind, to stop, to run directly on,</p>
	<p class="line">His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.</p>
	<p class="line">And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;</p>
	<p class="line">He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;</p>
	<p class="line">A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds</p>
	<p class="line">On abjects, orts and imitations,</p>
	<p class="line">Which, out of use and staled by other men,</p>
	<p class="line">Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,</p>
	<p class="line">But as a property. And now, Octavius,</p>
	<p class="line">Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius</p>
	<p class="line">Are levying powers: we must straight make head:</p>
	<p class="line">Therefore let our alliance be combined,</p>
	<p class="line">Our best friends made, our means stretch'd</p>
	<p class="line">And let us presently go sit in council,</p>
	<p class="line">How covert matters may be best disclosed,</p>
	<p class="line">And open perils surest answered.</p>

	<p class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Let us do so: for we are at the stake,</p>
	<p class="line">And bay'd about with many enemies;</p>
	<p class="line">And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,</p>
	<p class="line">Millions of mischiefs.</p>

	<p class="speaker">LUCILIUS</p>

	<p class="line">To do you salutation from his master.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,</p>
	<p class="line">In his own change, or by ill officers,</p>
	<p class="line">Hath given me some worthy cause to wish</p>
	<p class="line">Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,</p>
	<p class="line">I shall be satisfied.</p>

	<p class="speaker">PINDARUS</p>
	<p class="line">I do not doubt</p>
	<p class="line">But that my noble master will appear</p>
	<p class="line">Such as he is, full of regard and honour.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;</p>
	<p class="line">How he received you, let me be resolved.</p>

	<p class="speaker">LUCILIUS</p>
	<p class="line">With courtesy and with respect enough;</p>
	<p class="line">But not with such familiar instances,</p>
	<p class="line">Nor with such free and friendly conference,</p>
	<p class="line">As he hath used of old.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Thou hast described</p>
	<p class="line">A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,</p>
	<p class="line">When love begins to sicken and decay,</p>
	<p class="line">It useth an enforced ceremony.</p>
	<p class="line">There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;</p>
	<p class="line">But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,</p>
	<p class="line">Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;</p>
	<p class="line">But when they should endure the bloody spur,</p>
	<p class="line">They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,</p>
	<p class="line">Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?</p>

	<h3>SCENE III. Brutus's tent.</h3>

	<i>Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS</i>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:</p>
	<p class="line">You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella</p>
	<p class="line">For taking bribes here of the Sardians;</p>
	<p class="line">Wherein my letters, praying on his side,</p>
	<p class="line">Because I knew the man, were slighted off.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">You wronged yourself to write in such a case.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">In such a time as this it is not meet</p>
	<p class="line">That every nice offence should bear his comment.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself</p>
	<p class="line">Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;</p>
	<p class="line">To sell and mart your offices for gold</p>
	<p class="line">To undeservers.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">                  I an itching palm!</p>
	<p class="line">You know that you are Brutus that speak this,</p>
	<p class="line">Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">The name of Cassius honours this corruption,</p>
	<p class="line">And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Chastisement!</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Remember March, the ides of March remember:</p>
	<p class="line">Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?</p>
	<p class="line">What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,</p>
	<p class="line">And not for justice? What, shall one of us</p>
	<p class="line">That struck the foremost man of all this world</p>
	<p class="line">But for supporting robbers, shall we now</p>
	<p class="line">Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,</p>
	<p class="line">And sell the mighty space of our large honours</p>
	<p class="line">For so much trash as may be grasped thus?</p>
	<p class="line">I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,</p>
	<p class="line">Than such a Roman.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">                  Brutus, bay not me;</p>
	<p class="line">I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,</p>
	<p class="line">To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,</p>
	<p class="line">Older in practise, abler than yourself</p>
	<p class="line">To make conditions.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Go to; you are not, Cassius.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">I am.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">I say you are not.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;</p>
	<p class="line">Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Away, slight man!</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Is't possible?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">                  Hear me, for I will speak.</p>
	<p class="line">Must I give way and room to your rash choler?</p>
	<p class="line">Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;</p>
	<p class="line">Go show your slaves how choleric you are,</p>
	<p class="line">And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?</p>
	<p class="line">Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch</p>
	<p class="line">Under your testy humour? By the gods</p>
	<p class="line">You shall digest the venom of your spleen,</p>
	<p class="line">Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,</p>
	<p class="line">I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,</p>
	<p class="line">When you are waspish.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Is it come to this?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">You say you are a better soldier:</p>
	<p class="line">Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,</p>
	<p class="line">And it shall please me well: for mine own part,</p>
	<p class="line">I shall be glad to learn of noble men.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;</p>
	<p class="line">I said, an elder soldier, not a better:</p>
	<p class="line">Did I say 'better'?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">If you did, I care not.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">I durst not!</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">No.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">What, durst not tempt him!</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">For your life you durst not!</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Do not presume too much upon my love;</p>
	<p class="line">I may do that I shall be sorry for.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">You have done that you should be sorry for.</p>
	<p class="line">There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,</p>
	<p class="line">For I am arm'd so strong in honesty</p>
	<p class="line">That they pass by me as the idle wind,</p>
	<p class="line">Which I respect not. I did send to you</p>
	<p class="line">For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:</p>
	<p class="line">For I can raise no money by vile means:</p>
	<p class="line">By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,</p>
	<p class="line">And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring</p>
	<p class="line">From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash</p>
	<p class="line">By any indirection: I did send</p>
	<p class="line">To you for gold to pay my legions,</p>
	<p class="line">Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?</p>
	<p class="line">Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?</p>
	<p class="line">When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,</p>
	<p class="line">To lock such rascal counters from his friends,</p>
	<p class="line">Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;</p>
	<p class="line">Dash him to pieces!</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">I denied you not.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">You did.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">I did not: he was but a fool that brought</p>
	<p class="line">My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:</p>
	<p class="line">A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,</p>
	<p class="line">But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">I do not, till you practise them on me.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">You love me not.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">                  I do not like your faults.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">A friendly eye could never see such faults.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">A flatterer's would not, though they do appear</p>
	<p class="line">As huge as high Olympus.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,</p>
	<p class="line">Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,</p>
	<p class="line">For Cassius is aweary of the world;</p>
	<p class="line">Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;</p>
	<p class="line">Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,</p>
	<p class="line">Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,</p>
	<p class="line">To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep</p>
	<p class="line">My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,</p>
	<p class="line">And here my naked breast; within, a heart</p>
	<p class="line">Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:</p>
	<p class="line">If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;</p>
	<p class="line">I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:</p>
	<p class="line">Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,</p>
	<p class="line">When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better</p>
	<p class="line">Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Sheathe your dagger:</p>
	<p class="line">Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;</p>
	<p class="line">Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.</p>
	<p class="line">O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb</p>
	<p class="line">That carries anger as the flint bears fire;</p>
	<p class="line">Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,</p>
	<p class="line">And straight is cold again.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Hath Cassius lived</p>
	<p class="line">To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,</p>
	<p class="line">When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">And my heart too.</p>

	<p class="line">                  O Brutus!</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">What's the matter?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Have not you love enough to bear with me,</p>
	<p class="line">When that rash humour which my mother gave me</p>
	<p class="line">Makes me forgetful?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Come in, Titinius!</p>
	<p><i>Exit LUCIUS</i></p>
	<p><i>Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA</i></p>
	<p class="line">Welcome, good Messala.</p>
	<p class="line">Now sit we close about this taper here,</p>
	<p class="line">And call in question our necessities.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Portia, art thou gone?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">No more, I pray you.</p>
	<p class="line">Messala, I have here received letters,</p>
	<p class="line">That young Octavius and Mark Antony</p>
	<p class="line">Come down upon us with a mighty power,</p>
	<p class="line">Bending their expedition toward Philippi.</p>

	<p class="speaker">MESSALA</p>
	<p class="line">Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">With what addition?</p>

	<p class="speaker">MESSALA</p>
	<p class="line">That by proscription and bills of outlawry,</p>
	<p class="line">Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,</p>
	<p class="line">Have put to death an hundred senators.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Therein our letters do not well agree;</p>
	<p class="line">Mine speak of seventy senators that died</p>
	<p class="line">By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Cicero one!</p>

	<p class="speaker">MESSALA</p>
	<p class="line">          Cicero is dead,</p>
	<p class="line">And by that order of proscription.</p>
	<p class="line">Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">No, Messala.</p>

	<p class="speaker">MESSALA</p>
	<p class="line">Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Nothing, Messala.</p>

	<p class="speaker">MESSALA</p>
	<p class="line">                  That, methinks, is strange.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?</p>

	<p class="speaker">MESSALA</p>
	<p class="line">No, my lord.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.</p>

	<p class="speaker">MESSALA</p>
	<p class="line">Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:</p>
	<p class="line">For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:</p>
	<p class="line">With meditating that she must die once,</p>
	<p class="line">I have the patience to endure it now.</p>

	<p class="speaker">MESSALA</p>
	<p class="line">Even so great men great losses should endure.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">I have as much of this in art as you,</p>
	<p class="line">But yet my nature could not bear it so.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Well, to our work alive. What do you think</p>
	<p class="line">Of marching to Philippi presently?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">I do not think it good.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Your reason?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">This it is:</p>
	<p class="line">'Tis better that the enemy seek us:</p>
	<p class="line">So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,</p>
	<p class="line">Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,</p>
	<p class="line">Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.</p>
	<p class="line">The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground</p>
	<p class="line">Do stand but in a forced affection;</p>
	<p class="line">For they have grudged us contribution:</p>
	<p class="line">The enemy, marching along by them,</p>
	<p class="line">By them shall make a fuller number up,</p>
	<p class="line">Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;</p>
	<p class="line">From which advantage shall we cut him off,</p>
	<p class="line">If at Philippi we do face him there,</p>
	<p class="line">These people at our back.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Hear me, good brother.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Under your pardon. You must note beside,</p>
	<p class="line">That we have tried the utmost of our friends,</p>
	<p class="line">Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:</p>
	<p class="line">The enemy increaseth every day;</p>
	<p class="line">We, at the height, are ready to decline.</p>
	<p class="line">There is a tide in the affairs of men,</p>
	<p class="line">Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;</p>
	<p class="line">Omitted, all the voyage of their life</p>
	<p class="line">Is bound in shallows and in miseries.</p>
	<p class="line">On such a full sea are we now afloat;</p>
	<p class="line">And we must take the current when it serves,</p>
	<p class="line">Or lose our ventures.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Then, with your will, go on;</p>
	<p class="line">We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">The deep of night is crept upon our talk,</p>
	<p class="line">And nature must obey necessity;</p>
	<p class="line">Which we will niggard with a little rest.</p>
	<p class="line">There is no more to say?</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">No more. Good night:</p>
	<p class="line">Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.</p>

	<h3>SCENE I. The plains of Philippi.</h3>

	<i>Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army</i>

	<p class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:</p>
	<p class="line">You said the enemy would not come down,</p>
	<p class="line">But keep the hills and upper regions;</p>
	<p class="line">It proves not so: their battles are at hand;</p>
	<p class="line">They mean to warn us at Philippi here,</p>
	<p class="line">Answering before we do demand of them.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know</p>
	<p class="line">Wherefore they do it: they could be content</p>
	<p class="line">To visit other places; and come down</p>
	<p class="line">With fearful bravery, thinking by this face</p>
	<p class="line">To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;</p>
	<p class="line">But 'tis not so.</p>
	<p><i>Enter a Messenger</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
	<p class="line">                  Prepare you, generals:</p>
	<p class="line">The enemy comes on in gallant show;</p>
	<p class="line">Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,</p>
	<p class="line">And something to be done immediately.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">Octavius, lead your battle softly on,</p>
	<p class="line">Upon the left hand of the even field.</p>

	<p class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">Why do you cross me in this exigent?</p>

	<p class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">I do not cross you; but I will do so.</p>
	<p><i>March</i></p>
	<p><i>Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army; LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others</i></p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">They stand, and would have parley.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.</p>

	<p class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.</p>
	<p class="line">Make forth; the generals would have some words.</p>

	<p class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Stir not until the signal.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?</p>

	<p class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Not that we love words better, as you do.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:</p>
	<p class="line">Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,</p>
	<p class="line">Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Antony,</p>
	<p class="line">The posture of your blows are yet unknown;</p>
	<p class="line">But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,</p>
	<p class="line">And leave them honeyless.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">Not stingless too.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">O, yes, and soundless too;</p>
	<p class="line">For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,</p>
	<p class="line">And very wisely threat before you sting.</p>

	<p class="speaker">ANTONY</p>
	<p class="line">Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers</p>
	<p class="line">Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:</p>
	<p class="line">You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,</p>
	<p class="line">And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;</p>
	<p class="line">Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind</p>
	<p class="line">Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:</p>
	<p class="line">This tongue had not offended so to-day,</p>
	<p class="line">If Cassius might have ruled.</p>

	<p class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,</p>
	<p class="line">The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;</p>
	<p class="line">I draw a sword against conspirators;</p>
	<p class="line">When think you that the sword goes up again?</p>
	<p class="line">Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds</p>
	<p class="line">Be well avenged; or till another Caesar</p>
	<p class="line">Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,</p>
	<p class="line">Unless thou bring'st them with thee.</p>

	<p class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">So I hope;</p>
	<p class="line">I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,</p>
	<p class="line">Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,</p>

	<p class="speaker">OCTAVIUS</p>
	<p class="line">                  Come, Antony, away!</p>
	<p class="line">Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:</p>
	<p class="line">If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;</p>
	<p class="line">If not, when you have stomachs.</p>

	<p class="line">And his opinion: now I change my mind,</p>

	<p class="line">Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign</p>
	<p class="line">Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,</p>
	<p class="line">Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;</p>
	<p class="line">Who to Philippi here consorted us:</p>
	<p class="line">This morning are they fled away and gone;</p>
	<p class="line">And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,</p>

	<p class="line">Believe not so.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">                  I but believe it partly;</p>

	<p class="line">The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,</p>
	<p class="line">Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!</p>
	<p class="line">But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,</p>
	<p class="line">Let's reason with the worst that may befall.</p>
	<p class="line">If we do lose this battle, then is this</p>
	<p class="line">The very last time we shall speak together:</p>
	<p class="line">What are you then determined to do?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>

	<p class="line">By which I did blame Cato for the death</p>
	<p class="line">Which he did give himself, I know not how,</p>
	<p class="line">But I do find it cowardly and vile,</p>
	<p class="line">For fear of what might fall, so to prevent</p>
	<p class="line">The time of life: arming myself with patience</p>
	<p class="line">To stay the providence of some high powers</p>
	<p class="line">That govern us below.</p>

	<p class="line">Then, if we lose this battle,</p>
	<p class="line">You are contented to be led in triumph</p>
	<p class="line">Thorough the streets of Rome?</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,</p>
	<p class="line">That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;</p>
	<p class="line">He bears too great a mind. But this same day</p>
	<p class="line">Must end that work the ides of March begun;</p>
	<p class="line">And whether we shall meet again I know not.</p>
	<p class="line">Therefore our everlasting farewell take:</p>
	<p class="line">For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!</p>
	<p class="line">If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;</p>
	<p class="line">If not, why then, this parting was well made.</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>
	<p class="line">For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!</p>
	<p class="line">If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;</p>
	<p class="line">If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.</p>

	<p class="speaker">BRUTUS</p>
	<p class="line">Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know</p>
	<p class="line">The end of this day's business ere it come!</p>
	<p class="line">But it sufficeth that the day will end,</p>
	<p class="line">And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!</p>

	<p class="line">Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:</p>
	<p class="line">This ensign here of mine was turning back;</p>
	<p class="line">I slew the coward, and did take it from him.</p>

	<p class="speaker">TITINIUS</p>
	<p class="line">O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;</p>
	<p class="line">Who, having some advantage on Octavius,</p>
	<p class="line">Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,</p>

	<p class="speaker">CASSIUS</p>

	<p class="line">My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,</p>
	<p class="line">And tell me what thou notest about the field.</p>
	<p><i>PINDARUS ascends the hill</i></p>

	<p><i>PINDARUS descends</i></p>

	<p class="line">And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,</p>
	<p class="line">That whatsoever I did bid thee do,</p>
	<p class="line">Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;</p>
	<p class="line">Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,</p>

	<p class="speaker">PINDARUS</p>
	<p class="line">So, I am free; yet would not so have been,</p>

	<p class="line">The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,</p>
	<p class="line">Thou never comest unto a happy birth,</p>

	<p class="speaker">MESSALA</p>
	<p class="line">Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet</p>
